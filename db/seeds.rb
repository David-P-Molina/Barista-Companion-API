ten_drops = Roaster.find_or_create_by(name: 'Ten Drops', description: "Ten Drops derives its name from a Icelandic/Scandinavian idea 'Tíu dropar.' In essence, it's polite to offer a visitor coffee, but maybe you're hoping they won't hog all of it--save some for the fish! And on the other side it's maybe uncomfortable to turn down that hospitality, or rude to drink all of the available coffee... so you'd say 'just ten drops'--just a little coffee!. Our goal is to bring independent, local, specialty coffee to Plainfield. We deserve a place to get beans that are within days of their roast date, not weeks or months. Those who understand specialty coffee, know the difference. Those who don't know what the fuss is about... maybe we can help. We will only offer things that we would be thrilled to drink.
